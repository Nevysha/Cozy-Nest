Cozy Nest is a UI extension for Automatic's sd-webui. Inspired by [anapnoe](https://github.com/anapnoe/stable-diffusion-webui-ux)'s work

Tested in Chrome, should work in Firefox with minor bug. I plan to fix it later.

Features:
- [x]  Resizable panels
- [x]  Full Screen Inpainting
- [x]  Tab menu on top or left
- [x]  Customizable via Auto1111 Settings
- [x]  Cozy look with dark or light theme (add `?__theme=light` in url or set `--theme=light` in Auto1111 start arguments to switch to light theme)
- [x]  Save resize bar position / panel ratio in local storage
- [x]  Customize accent color
- [x]  Add or remove accent to the generate buttons
- [x]  Customize font size
- [x]  Move settings in a dedicated collapsible tab
- [x]  Smaller bottom padding bar to get a bit more screen space

It's made by being a bit hacky on the DOM to tweaks Gradio default features and existing css of Auto1111. It will probably break with each update of auto1111, but I'll try to keep it up to date.
